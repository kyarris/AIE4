        "#### Lessons Learned\n",
        "1. The enhancement of adding metadata to a Vector database helped me in my work life as it was part of an enrichment process I was going through. This helped solidify my foundations\n",
        "2. The concept of \"checking\" vector similarity by subtracting man from King and having a similarity to Queen helped me understand the concept of a 'vector' and how it relates to the mathematical or physics representation of a vector.\n",
        "3. For most use cases, RAG seems to suffice as searching over a select bit of information for a specific use case is less effort than fine-tuning but can yeild surprisingly powerful Results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Lessons NOT Learned\n",
        "1. I still conceptually don't undertand the \"assistant\" role and how it differs from \"system\", is it just for saved session information about previous messages in a chat for example? I don't see the value in this role.\n",
        "2. I am still confused as to how the Vector DB algorithmically defines the vector and finds similar vectors. I get the idea of cosine similarity but bue actual 'retrieval' part is still black box to me. \n",
        "3. I still need to understand more about chunking, If it is just splitting up the text into more bitesize peices for LLM to digest, that makes sense, but somehow I feel like creating a vector score for a whole text file seems more valuable? Perhaps if your response just needs to be a snippet of information from a file?"
